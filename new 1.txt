git commands:
git status # it returns the status of the working directory
git add .  # it marks all the files that are needed to be updated
git commit -m # it commits or create a object which need to be updated
git push origin main # it push the files which are situated in local repo to the remote repo






data types
1) char size of char 1byte

2) int size 4 byte
3)double size 8 byte
note: by default signed data is most signed bit

4) float -4tpes
stores 6digits of decision
5) manipulators
2tpes- 1)the one that change sign(signed, unsigned)
2)the one that changes size(short,long)
note: by defalut by int is longint
thus int is long int and signed long int
long long int is 8byte
short int is 2 byte

KEYWORDS:
1.for,while,do (loops)
2.switch,case,default(to implement choosing between the options)
3.if,else(to implement binary condition)
4.break,: to take control out of the block
 continue: to skip remaining insructions of current iteration and continue wih the nxt itration
 
 return: to return control to the caller(calling function).alternatively we can return a value also.
5. struct,union,enum(to create user defined data types)
6.static: to create a global variable with file scope& to ceate a local variable with life till end of the program
7. void: to mention that function doesnt return a value
8. extern: to use an external variable(global varable declared in some othr file)
9.const: to create aread only variable(constant variable)
10. arithmtc oprts:+,-,*,/
all re bianry oprts (binry oprts r which requires 2 operands) inpt are numbers,outputs is number 
evaluted from left to right
ex: in x+y-z (x+y is evaluted frst)
the + &- oprts have lesser precedens(priority)
the associtivity is over written by precedens of operts  ex: in  x-y|z y-z is evaluated frst
in evry opertn data types of the oprnds must be same
infix notation is used
the evauation of any artmtc exprsion is written in infix notaion is conveted in postfix
